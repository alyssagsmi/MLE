I am intimately interested in disecting the parallels between cognitive behavior in computers and in those falling on the spectrum of Neurodivergence (ADHD, Autism, Etc). Sometimes people think we think like robots, I like to build robots in order to understand things, and I happen to have a very pattern-seeking attribute!

Seeking further research on neuroscience, cognitive science and the potential prowess of assistive technology created with machine learning principles in mind that help instruct and shape prompts, social scripts, and automating execuitve function tasks and language processing.

Obviously I need to back this up, please stay tuned for more
