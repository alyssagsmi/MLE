# MLE
Machine Learning projects (Upload in progress)

HARK!

Who goes there??

This be the place I drop my adventures in Machine learning and learning itself.

I have worked on projects in agricultural research in image processing, computer vision, and data analytics, and primarily find interest in using MLE as a tool to conduct meaningful exploration in interdisciplanary applications (sustainability, social impact, and assistive technology). 

I intend to fill this space with said projects!

BE WARNED! INNOVATION AHEAD!!!
